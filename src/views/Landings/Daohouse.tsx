        <h2>DAO House - Treasury Management Solution</h2>
        <span>
        DAO House is a turnkey, customizable, on-chain, and actively managed treasury solution designed specifically for DAOs. Yam employs a Treasury Management as a Service model (TMaaS), for helping DAOs ensure future growth and the long-term sustainability of their protocol. 
        All powered by the Set Protocol best-of-breed and battle-tested smart contract trading infrastructure.

        A DAO House solution benefits customers by allowing them to outsource the complexity of treasury management and focus 100% of their valuable human resources on the mission critical goal of building great DeFi products. 
        The Yam ecosystem benefits from setup and annual service fees, both of which accrue to the Yam treasury and help grow the Yam ecosystem.
